1-1) a) Sends a request to a host, requesting a response
     b) -n
     c) Sends an ICMP package to the target host, requesting a reponse
     d) ping 10.17.1.1

1-2) a) Getting the route packets take to a host
     b) Figures out the route by using an increasing time-to-live, starting at one and increasing by one for
	every n (default to 3) packages, until arriving at the target host.
     c) -n
     d) traceroute ida.liu.se:
	1  idagw-185.ida.liu.se (130.236.185.1)  3.524 ms  3.517 ms  3.719 ms
	2  portofix.ida.liu.se (130.236.177.25)  0.751 ms  0.760 ms  0.756 ms

	Package first gets to idagw-185.ida.liu.se, at IP 130.236.185.1, with the three time results for each probe package.
	For the second row, we arrive at portofix, with the columns having the same meanings as the previous line.

1-3) a) ifconfig eth0 130.236.189.14 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 130.236.189.255
        ip addr 139.236.189.14/24 broadcast 130.236.189.255 dev eth0

     b) With route, it's just "route"
        ip: ip route list
        netstat: netstat -r

1-4) a) A sysctl is a kernel parameter, which are the settings used by the kernel during runtime
     b) /etc/sysctl.conf
     c) net.ipv4.ip_forward

1-5) Addresses 130.236.179.65 to 130.236.179.70. d1-gw.sysinst.ida.liu.se and d1.sysinst.ida.liu.se for names.
     Netmask 255.255.255.248. Broadcast 130.236.179.71.

1-6) Routing determines if the packet has reached the destination host, and if so, the packet is passed up the network stack. 
     If it has not, it determines which interface to forward the packet to. Forwarding is simply the act of moving the packet to 
     another interface.

2-1) This test if a part of the larger Networking test

7-1) a) /etc/nsswitch.conf
     b) /etc/resolv.conf (and /etc/host.conf)
     c) Determines the domains to be used for host-name lookup

8-1) Quagga is split into several daemons. zebra is the routing table manager. There are then several daemons, ospfd, bgpd and ripd, to handle the OSPF, BGP and RIP protocols respectively.

8-2) Configuration files are found in /etc/quagga/. Each daemon has its own config file, such as zebra.conf.

8-3) Through the shell vtysh, which is bundled with quagga. The command 'write file'

9-1) A new router requests the routing tables of its neighbor routers. Using this, the router computes its own routing table, which is broadcasted at intervals. At these intervals, neighbor routers will reprocess its own routing table, using the given information.

9-2) It should send its routing table. In our case, it would only be sent to sysinst-gw.ida.liu.se.
