11-1) RAID 1+0 offers more fault tolerance, due to having the drives divided into more groups.

11-2) Due to disk sizes increasing, but read error rates remaining the same, the risk of failing to rebuild
      after a disk crash become almost certain.

11-3) The journal is used for "storing" intended changes, before they are made. That way, if the change requires
      multiple operation, but a crash occurs while only some, but not all, operations have been executed, it
      reduces the chance of data corruption or storage leaks.

11-4) The purpose of LVMs is to provide more complex setups than simple partitioning. It allows for grouping together
      physical or logical drives, making it possible to split drives into logical partitions which are more flexible
      than regular partitions, or to group drives together into RAIDs.
