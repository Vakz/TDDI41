This is the 2016 version of the course.
The files in the root are a mess, but in the directories "inl1" and "inl2" are the more organized versions that were actually turned in. Unfortunately, we didn't really keep the config files up to date here, so you're out of luck there.

If using our tests (in the test_scripts directory), remember to go through them and adjust ip addresses, domain names, host names, and anything else that was webreg group specific. Tests are run either by running the individual files, or by running _test_all.py._ If writing more tests, you'll probably want to add them to test_all.py. Tests assume users are named _user1_ and _user2_, and there are no other users than user1, user2 and root.
