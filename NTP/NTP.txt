2-1) Servers are organized in a hierarchy, where the reference clocks are at Stratum 0. Reference clocks use 
     something else than other servers to keep time, such as atomic clocks or similar. Clocks which use Stratum 0
     servers to keep their time are called Stratum 1. Servers using Stratum 1 to syncronize their clocks are
     called Stratum 2, and so on, up to Stratum 15.

2-2) The maximum is 1000 seconds. If the time difference is greater than this, ntpd will exit.

2-3) Setting the clock may cause weird behavior, especially in the case of the host being "ahead" in time. If just
     setting the clock outright, it could cause the same time to occur twice, or for events to be logged in the 
     incorrect order (Event A happens at time X, event B at time Y. Time is reset to time X. Event C would now
     be logged at time X, earlier than Event B, despite occuring after B).
