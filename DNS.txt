1-2) a) It will never respond to queries with cached results. All responses are results of either static 
        configurations or calculated dynamically.

     b) A zone is a part of a domain. A single domain can be authoriative for more than one zone.

     c) A recursive query is when a DNS gets a request it does not know the answer for, it goes on to make the same
        request of another DNS. In the case of a non-recursive query, the DNS will instead answer with which DNS to 
        ask, rather than directly asking. An authoriative name server will not respond to recursive queries.

     d) Delegation can be used simply for load balancing, or to replicate a more physical structure, such as  	
        departments within a company, or on a larger scale, splitting TLDs into separate zones.

     e) A resource record is the actual information one usually wants from a DNS, such as the IP address linked to a 
        name. Records are of different types, such as an A record, which contains an IP-address, an NS record, which
	is when the record has been delegated to another server, and several other types.

     f) The Answer section contains resource records that answer the actual query stated.
        The Authority section contains resource records pointing to authoriative name servers, which may be used
	to further attempt to resolve the query.
        The Additional section contains any resource records which may be of use, but neither answers the
	query directly nor points to any authoriative name servers.

     g) In the DNS Message Header, there are flags for "Authoriative Answer" and "Recursion Desired" respecitevly.

     f) Glue records are used when the name server is a subdomain of the actual target domain.  Their purpose is to 		avoid the loop created when attempting to reach example.com, beinsg redirected to ns1.example.com, which in
	in turn would require knowing how to reach example.com, and so forth. This is done using the NS record type,
	delegating example.com to ns1.example.com

1-3) blox.it.liu.se. 130.236.1.205.

1-4) The purpose is to give the ability to create smaller zones, and to avoid being limited to octet boundries. This is done simply by prefixing with the network block, such as 29/64.179.236.130.in-addr.arpa

2-1) a) informatix.ida.liu.se has address 130.236.177.26
     
     b) informatix.ida.liu.se has address 130.236.177.26 

     c) liu.se has address 130.236.5.66

2-2) a) Because it doesn't know.

     b) Because ns3 is an authoriative name server, it doesn't accept recursive queries. Since it doesn't know the
        answer to the query, it simply retuns empty.

3-1) registry.ip-only.net

3-2) 4

3-3) host -v sysinst.ida.liu.se. All info has been found if authority is zero.

4-1) a) 130.236.178.1
     b) sysinst-gw.ida.liu.se
	ns.ida.liu.se

     c) idagw-189.ida.liu.se

4-2)a) In our case, the following, in order: 130.236.1.9, k.root-servers.net, g.ns.se, sunic.sunet.se, ns1.liu.se

    b) Result is in two queries:
	update.microsoft.com follows, in order, 130.236.1.9, m.root-servers.net, g.gtld-servers.net, ns2.msft.net.
	This results in update.microsoft.com.nsatc.net
       Quering this, results in: 130.236.1.9, j.root-servers.net, c.gtld-servers.net, d.ns.nsatc.net.
